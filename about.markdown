# About Us

Biometix was established in 1998 by Dr Ted Dunstone as a way to pursue his dream of working in emerging technologies, including biometrics. In 2002, Biometix implemented the SmartGate prototype, the world’s first biometric automated border control system as part of a global trend towards heightened security post 9/11. Since then, Biometix has been working at the forefront of biometrics, conducting world-leading research and applying this knowledge to our products and projects across the globe.

Biometix continues to provide strong unbiased advice about all aspects of biometric systems for many government and corporate clients in Asia, Europe and the US. We also have a strong commitment to research and development, having published pioneering papers in the area of biometric analysis techniques for which we received an IEEE best paper award in 1997. Biometix was also awarded the prestigious “Most Innovative Security Product” at The Security Summit, held in San Diego in 2010.

Dr Dunstone also founded the Biometrics Institute in 2001 responding to an industry need for an impartial forum for sharing knowledge and information about biometrics. By August 2015 the Institute has grown to include 180 organisations (650 individuals) from 24 different countries.

Biometric systems are complex and very different to traditional security methods. Clients turn to us to provide independent advice, assessment and assurance where there are a range of vendors, technologies and risks. Biometix is recognised globally as one of the only biometric consulting firms that can combine vendor independence, world-leading research and strong technical depth delivered by local Australian talent.

Biometix primarily provides our products and services to immigration, border control and intelligence agencies within Europe, USA and NZ, however we also have engagements with the financial sector, resources sector and professional services firms.
