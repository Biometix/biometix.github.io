## Setting Up

``` mermaid

config:
  theme: neutral
  layout: elk
---

graph TD
  download[Download the docker compose file] --> run(Spin up the container)
  run --> web{Visit localhost:8848/docs}

```

## Integration

BQAT API is designed to be a self-contained backend service for biometrics analysis. It could be considered the endpoint from the front-end product. 

> The codebase in this repository does not include proper configuration for production environment, so you may want to set up your proxy server, domain, web server workers, etc. 

## Workflow

``` mermaid

  theme: neutral
  layout: elk

---

1. Create a scan task with your input dataset (__POST /scan/__), the dataset could come from local `data/` folder or upload via the HTTP request.
2. Note down the task ID (`tid`) from the response, and check the status of this task (__GET /task/{task id}/__).
3. Retrieve the results using dataset ID (`collection` ID from response above) from the server (__GET /scan/{dataset id}/profiles__).

## Endpoints

---

<!-- ### POST /scan/

Create scan task from images in `data/` folder mounted to the container.

--- -->

### POST /scan/uploaded

Create scan task from images uploaded via the endpoint. 

---

### GET /task/{task_id}/

Check task status.

---

### GET /scan/{dataset_id}/profiles

Create scan task from images uploaded via the endpoint. 

---

### GET /scan/{dataset_id}/outliers

Try to detect outliers of this dataset (task).

---

### GET /scan/{dataset_id}/report
