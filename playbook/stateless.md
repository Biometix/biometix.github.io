## Setting Up

``` mermaid

graph TD
  download[Download the docker compose file] --> run(Spin up the container)
  run --> doc{localhost:8848/docs}

```

---

## Workflow

``` mermaid

graph LR
  A[Frontend] --> B([Biometrics])
  B --> C{BQAT Stateless API}
  C --> |Outputs| A

```

---

## Endpoints

---

### POST /file

Upload a biometric file for quality assessment:

- **file**: biometric file
- **modality**: specify modality of the biometric

---

### POST /base64

Upload a biometric file (base64) for quality assessment:

- **modality**: specify modality of the biometric.
- **type**: biometric file type (png, jpg, wav, jp2, etc.).
- **data**: biometric file encoded as base64 string.
- **id**: biometric file identifier.
- **timestamp**: ISO 8601 date and time format.

## Scalability

Due to BQAT's compute-intensive nature, the serverâ€™s throughput is primarily limited by the CPU of the host machine, including factors such as the number of cores and single-thread performance.â€‹
    
Scaling options:â€‹

+ Vertical: deploy to a machine with larger CPU.â€‹

+ Horizontal: deploy to a cluster of machines (e.g. Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc.)

### Example (Docker Swarm):

> This is for local small scale deployment, use Kubernetes for large scale production environment.

> This example is tested on Linux nodes only, further configuration might be needed for Windows and macOS.

#### Prepare worker nodes

+ Make sure you have all your worker machines/VMs installed with [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/);

+ Take note of their IP addresses.

#### Set up cluster

Select one machine as the manager, then open the terminal on this manager computer:

``` sh
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>
```

Use the command printed from previous step to add worker nodes (looks like this). Run this command on all the worker nodes:

``` sh
docker swarm join --token kz5s954yi3oex3nedyz0fb0xx1 192.168.101.101:8008
```

After all your worker nodes joined, check if your cluster was set up properly:

``` sh
docker node ls
```

#### Deploy to cluster

Deploy BQAT-Stateless to the cluster:

``` sh
docker stack deploy --compose-file compose.yaml bqat-stateless
```

Check service status

``` sh
docker stack services bqat-stateless
```

Scale up the service using the worker nodes (4 replicas in this example):

``` sh
docker service scale bqat-stateless_server=4
```

> Congratulations! The cluster has been set up! ðŸŽ‰ You can now make requests to the endpoints as you typically would! The loads will be distributed across the worker nodes.

> Note: bring up more replicas than number of the physical machines might not further increase the throughput.

#### Clean up

Bring down the service:

``` sh
docker stack rm bqat-stateless
```

Disconnect worker node (on the worker machine):

``` sh
docker swarm leave
```

Remove the node from the cluster (on manager machine):

``` sh
docker node rm <NODE-ID>
```
