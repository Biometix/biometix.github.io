1. Local files

   - The user could import dataset as zip file to the server.

   - Or may transfer the data to the data folder on the machine (if you run it on your local machine or have access to the machine).

2. Remote files

   - The user could also upload files from the browser directely (limited number possible), and the data won't be saved on the server once processed.

---

You may filter the input files by filename or type.
