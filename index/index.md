# __Biometric Quality Assessment Tool (BQAT)__

## Overview

BQAT is a biometric quality assessment tool for generating and analysing given biometric samplesâ€™ quality to international standards as well as to customized metrics. The BQAT tool functions by taking an input directory of biometric data and will produce both the raw quality information as well as an analysis report.

The quality of biometric samples is a key aspect of the performance and usefulness of a biometric systems. Whilst there are a variety of tools per modality, this project is aimed to provide an open source framework to support all common modalities and allow for expansion as new methods are developed.

## Modality

+ __Fingerprint__

    The analysis of fingerprint engine based on NIST/NFIQ2 quality features. The quality score links image quality of optical and ink 500 PPI fingerprints to operational recognition performance.

+ __Face__

    The face image assessment module provides metrics includes head pose, smile detection, inter-eye-distance, closed eyes, etc.

+ __Iris__

    The iris sample assessment module provides various quality attributes, features, and ISO metrics.

+ __Speech__

    The speech assessment module provides various quality metrics, including naturalness, coloration, noisiness, etc.
