# Biometric Quality Assessment Tool (BQAT)

BQAT is a biometric quality assessment tool for generating and analysing biometric sample quality to international standards and supporting customized metrics. It takes as input directory of biometric images/data in standard formats (e.g. wsq, png, jpg) and output both the raw quality information as well as an analysis report.

+ ### Fingerprint
    The analysis of fingerprint engine based on NIST/NFIQ2 quality features. The quality score links image quality of optical and ink 500 PPI fingerprints to operational recognition performance.

+ ### Face
    The face image assessment provides metrics includes head pose, smile detection, inter-eye-distance, closed eyes, etc.

+ ### Iris
    The face image assessment provides various quality attributes, features, and ISO metrics.

It is available to be run from a docker image in multiple version. 

## Input & Output
### Input Format

For fingerprints the tool works with image formats WSQ and PNG. For both of these formats the image will be run directly through NFIQ2. The image formats JPG and BMP are also supported but will be converted to WSQ first before being run through NFIQ2.

NFIQ2 expects images to have a resolution of at least 500 PPI. The tool will force NFIQ2 to run on images of lower resolution but the result may be inaccurate.

### Output Format

The tool will produce a csv with all the quality scores generated by the engines and some additional columns.
