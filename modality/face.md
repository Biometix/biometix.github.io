## Overview

The face image assessment module provides metrics including head pose, smile detection, inter-eye distance, closed eyes, etc.


Face image quality issues to investigate:

![face_example](../assets/images/face_example.png)

***

## Input

+ __BQAT-CLI__: Create a folder named `data` under your working directory and put your face images in this folder.

+ __BQAT-API / BQAT-Stateless__: Upload images via web API.

+ __BQAT-GUI__: Upload images via web page interface.

## Output

BQAT will produce quality metrics generated by processing engine selected in addition to input file metadata. The outputs will be stored as `CSV` via BQAT-CLI or `JSON` via BQAT-API.

Optional processing engines:

+ [BQAT](https://biometix.github.io/modality/face.html#bqat) (default)
+ [OFIQ](https://biometix.github.io/modality/face.html#ofiq) (beta)
  - [ISO/IEC 29794-5](https://www.iso.org/standard/81005.html)
+ [BIQT](https://biometix.github.io/modality/face.html#biqt) (beta)
