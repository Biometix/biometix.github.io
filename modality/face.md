## Overview

The face image assessment module provides metrics including head pose, smile detection, inter-eye distance, closed eyes, etc.


Face image quality issues to investigate:

![face_example](../assets/images/face_example.png)

***

## Input

+ __BQAT-CLI__: Create a folder named `data` under your working directory and put your face images in this folder.

+ __BQAT-API / BQAT-Stateless__: Upload images via web API.

+ __BQAT-GUI__: Upload images via web page interface.

{: .highlight }
Supported file type: JPG, JPEG, JP2, BMP, PNG

## Output

BQAT will produce quality metrics generated by processing engine selected in addition to input file metadata. The outputs will be stored as `CSV` via BQAT-CLI or `JSON` via BQAT-API.

Optional processing engines:

+ BQAT (default)
+ [OFIQ](https://pages.nist.gov/ifpc/2022/presentations/2_IFPC2022_OFIQ_Overview_Stratmann.pdf) (beta)
+ BIQT (beta)
