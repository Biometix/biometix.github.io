## Overview

The speech assessment module provides various quality metrics, including naturalness, colouration, noisiness, etc. 

## Input

Create a folder named `data` under your working directory and put your audio files in this folder.

Suported file formats:

+ `wav`

> Due to algorithm limitation, sub-folder might not work as expected. If your folder with audio files is in `data/speech/`, files in `data/speech/audio/` won't be processed.

***

## Output

BQAT will produce the quality scores generated by the engines as well as additional information in columns. It will be saved as CSV from CLI or JSON from API.

__Speech__:

| Column        | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Quality       | Overall quality estimation of the speech audio file. |
| Noisiness     | Quality degradation such as background, circuit, or coding noise. |
| Discontinuity | Quality degradation caused by isolated or non-stationary distortions, e.g. introduced by packet-loss or clipping. |
| Coloration    | Quality degradation caused by frequency response distortions, e.g. introduced by bandwidth limitation, low bitrate codecs, or packet-loss concealment. |
| Naturalness   | Estimation of the naturalness of synthetic speech. |
| Loudness      | Influence of the loudness on the perceived quality of transmitted speech. |
