<!-- ## Input

For fingerprints the tool works with image formats WSQ and PNG. For both of these formats the image will be run directly through NFIQ2. Image formats excluding WSQ and PNG are first converted into a compatible format before being run through NFIQ2.

_Any biometric sample which was had preprocessing or conversion applied to it during the quality assessment process will be noted within the output log._

NFIQ2 expects images to have a resolution of at least 500 PPI. The tool will force NFIQ2 to run on images of lower resolution but the result may be inaccurate.

## Output

The BQAT will produce the quality scores generated by the engines as well as additional info in columns. It will be saved as CSV from CLI or JSON from API. -->

## Report

In addition to raw output, BQAT will produce a simple statistical report on those assessment metrics.
